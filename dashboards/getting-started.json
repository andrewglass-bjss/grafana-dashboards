The dashboards available in this installation can be used to visualise data gathered by GitLab Performance Monitoring. For example, you can see how much time is spent in certain Rails controllers or how the garbage collector is behaving.\n\nThis particular dashboard acts as a way of helping you get started with Grafana and the dashboards provided by GitLab. First of all make sure that Grafana is configured properly as otherwise you won't be able to visualise any data.
